Performance Assessment
======================

^^^^^


In brief, performance assessment and comparison of multiple trimming alignment software
revealed that ClipKIT is a top-performing software.

**ClipKIT is a top-performing software for trimming multiple sequence alignments.** 
Across a total of 138,152 multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) from empirical (left) and
simulated (right) datasets, desirability-based integration of accuracy and support metrics
per MSA facilitated the comparison of relative software performance and revealed ClipKIT
is a top-performing software. MSA trimming approaches are ordered along the x-axis from
the highest-performing software to the lowest-performing software according to average
desirability-based rank. Abbreviations of trimmers and parameters are as follows: 
ClipKIT: g = gappy mode; ClipKIT: kc = kpic; ClipKIT: kcg = kpic-gappy; ClipKIT: k = kpi mode;
ClipKIT: kg = kpi-gappy mode; BMGE = BMGE default; BMGE 0.3 = 0.3 entropy threshold;
BMGE 0.7 = 0.7 entropy threshold; trimAl: s = strict; trimAl: sp = strictplus; Noisy = default;
Gblocks = default; No trim = no trimming.
