About
=====

^^^^^

**Clip**\ing and **K**\eeping **I**\nformation **T**\rimmer (**ClipKIT**) was developed as
part of `Jacob L. Steenwyk <https://jlsteenwyk.github.io/>`_'s graduate thesis work. 

For approximately 30 years, multiple sequence alignments have been filtered or "trimmed"
to remove sites that may cause errors in phylogenetic inference. Errors can be caused by
erroneously inferring site homology or saturation of multiple substitutions, both of which
often present as highly divergent sites. However, recent analysis by |TanLink|_ revealed 
current methods of alignment trimming often resulted in worse phylogenetic inferences.
These findings highlight the need for alternative MSA trimming strategies.

In light of these findings, we developed ClipKIT, which implements an innovative yet simple
trimming strategy. ClipKIT achieves this by identifying and retaining phylogenetically-informative
sites rather than identifying and trimming highly divergent ones. Our assessments of ClipKIT's
performance using empirical datasets of Mammalian and Yeast sequences and simulated sequences
from metazoans, flowering plants, filamentous fungi, and budding yeasts (:ref:`see details here 
<performance>`) suggests ClipKIT is a top-performing software.
