About
=====

^^^^^

**Clip**\ing and **K**\eeping **I**\nformation **T**\rimmer (**ClipKIT**) was developed as
part of `Jacob L. Steenwyk <https://jlsteenwyk.github.io/>`_'s graduate thesis work. 

The concept of ClipKIT is largely motviated by the work of |TanLink|_. Specifically, 
Tan and colleagues revealed alignment trimming software often resulted in worse single-gene
phylogenetic inferences. Additional analyses suggested that 'aggressive' alignment trimming
(or the removal of many sites in an alignment) was the main culprit. As a result, the
authors suggest that 'light' trimming may be the best strategy. However, the authors
note that the motivation of alignment trimming -- a process to remove alignment uncertainty
-- is just and that it is still possible to design effective trimming methods.

In light of these findings, we developed a simple and distinct trimming strategy implemented
in ClipKIT. Specifically, we provide methods for 'light' and 'aggressive' trimming, which
trim sites according to gappyness and whether or not it is parsimony informative,
respectively. Our assessments of ClipKIT's performance using empirical datasets of
Mammalian and Yeast sequences (:ref:`see details here <performance>`) suggest ClipKIT is a
top-performing software.
